CMake Warning (dev) in CMakeLists.txt:
  No project() command is present.  The top-level CMakeLists.txt file must
  contain a literal, direct call to the project() command.  Add a line of
  code such as

    project(ProjectName)

  near the top of the file, but after cmake_minimum_required().

  CMake is pretending there is a "project(Project)" command on the first
  line.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

  details.  Use the cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this
  warning.

  The target name "第四次实验" is reserved or not valid for certain
  CMake features, such as generator expressions, and may result in undefined
